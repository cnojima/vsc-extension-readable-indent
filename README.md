# readable-indent README

Indents imports, KVPs (like object literals) with a pivot point, padding whitespace for easy scanability.

## Features

Simple indentation will make your code easier to visually scan.  This extension will indent two common patterns on a pivot character:  `=` or  `:`

When applying readable-indent, use the pattern that makes the code snippet most readable:
### Left-justified readable-indent
![left-justified](docs/indent.gif)

### Center-justified readable-indent
![center-justified](docs/indent-with-pivot.gif)

## Usage
1. Select code snippet to make readable.
2. Use context menu (right|ctrl click) or key mapping to apply readable-indent
  * left-justfied indent: `ctrl-i ctrl-a`
  * center-justified indent: `ctrl-shift-b`

## Known Issues

Due to conflicting prioritization of whitespace between left & center-justified readable-indentation, toggling between the two will incrementally further indent the snippet.  The workaround is to undo the readable-indent before trying the other.

Obviously this indentation is conflicted with OOTB rules for `prettier`.  Pedagogy is out of scope for this extension ;).
